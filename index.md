Many new technologies for interactive documents, such as the 
[GAP native Jupyter Kernel](https://github.com/gap-packages/JupyterKernel),
[MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/), [ThebeLab](https://minrk.github.io/thebelab/)
have been developed recently.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together people who are
developing or using these technologies, and people who want to use them.
While combining the use of GAP and Jupyter is the main focus of this workshop,
people developing Jupyter or using Jupyter to access other software 
are of course welcome to attend. The topics include (but are not limited to):

* The GAP JupyterKernel
* Javascript-Visualizations using Jupyter
* Using Thebe for interactive manuals
* Developing teaching materials with Jupyter, and publishing
them using MyBinder
* Writing academic publications using MyBinder and Docker images, to
make all computational results and all examples fully and easily
reproducible.

The workshop is meant to collect ideas, start work on projects,
provide tutorials for use cases, etc.

Program information will continuously updated on [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).
