## Abstract

Joint work with A. Herrera-Poyatos and M. Martins

During this academic year I had the chance to teach GAP for a master course in our university. So this was a good chance to produce some "tutorials" for the students using the Jupyter kernel. This was an opportunity to see the caveats of using this front end, and as a side effect, several issues where reported in the github repository.

I have been also in contact with Manuel Martins, who is producing a GAP package called francy that among other things can be used to represent graphs, Hasse diagrams and trees. I started producing examples, and these showed the necessity to change some parts of the package and include new features. Now we are producing a package to represent graphs associated to elements in commutative monoids, draw Apéry sets in numerical semigroups and trees of varieties of numerical semigroups.
