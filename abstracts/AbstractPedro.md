## Abstract

Joint work with A. Herrera-Poyatos and M. Martins

During this academic year I had the chance to teach [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) for a [master course](http://masteres.ugr.es/doctomat/pages/info_academica/guias_docentes/2018/306/%21) in our [university](https://www.ugr.es). So this was a good excuse to produce some ["tutorials"](https://github.com/pedritomelenas/Software-Matematicas-GAP) for the students using the [native gap jupyter kernel](https://gap-packages.github.io/JupyterKernel/). This was an opportunity to see the caveats of using this front end, and as a side effect, several issues where reported in the github repository.

I have been also in contact with Manuel Martins, who is producing a gap package called [francy](https://github.com/mcmartins/francy), which among other things can be used to represent directed and undirected graphs. I started producing examples, and these showed the necessity to change some parts of the package and include new features (for instance trees). Now we are preparing a [package](https://github.com/pedritomelenas/francy-monoids) to represent graphs associated to elements in commutative monoids, draw Apéry sets in numerical semigroups and trees of varieties of numerical semigroups.

Some of these functions have their `dot` version. We are producing with A. Herrera-Poyatos a [series of procedures](https://github.com/pedritomelenas/dot-numericalsgps) to ouput graphs, Hasse diagrams and trees associated to monoids in `dot` language.
